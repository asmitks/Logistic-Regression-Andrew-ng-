# Logistic-Regression-Andrew-ng-
contains solutions to two problem statements using logistic regression:


1:
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and
you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants
that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions
decision.

2:
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the
test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or
rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results
on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model




These problems have been aproached through loitic regression.
